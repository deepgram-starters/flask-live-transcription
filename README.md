This sample demonstrates interacting with the Deepgram live streaming API using Flask, a micro web framework for Python.

## What is Deepgram?

## Sign-up to Deepgram

Before you start, it's essential to generate a Deepgram API key to use in this project. [Sign-up now for Deepgram and create an API key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

## Quickstart

### Manual

Follow these steps to get started with this starter application.

#### Clone the repository

Go to GitHub and [clone the repository](https://github.com/deepgram-starters/prerecorded-node-starter).

#### Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Edit the config file

Copy the code from `sample.env` and create a new file called `.env`. Paste in the code and enter your API key you generated in the [Deepgram console](https://console.deepgram.com/).

```js
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=%api_key%
```

#### Run the application

You need to run both app.py (port 8000) and app_socketio.py (port 5001). Once running, you can access the application in your browser at <http://127.0.0.1:8000>

```bash
python app.py
python app_socketio.py
```

#### SSL Error

If the SocketIO app raises an `WebSocketException` with CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED, you can add these lines in order to use the `certifi` trust files.
```python
# file:app_socketio.py
import os
# Add this import
import certifi

# Add this line anywhere before `dg_connection.start`
os.environ["SSL_CERT_FILE"] = certifi.where()
```

## Testing

To contribute or modify pytest code, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
pytest -v -s
```
